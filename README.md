## Deep Learning Project: BBC Auto News Categorization using _RNN_

1. Developed a deep learning project to categorize BBC Auto News articles using RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) and Python programming language.
2. Preprocessed and cleaned the news data, applied NLP techniques such as tokenization and stop word removal, and converted the text data into numerical form to prepare it for model training.
3. Trained an RNN model on the prepared data and achieved high accuracy in categorizing the auto news articles into different categories.
4. Tested the model and web app thoroughly to ensure accuracy and functionality.
5. Demonstrated strong skills in deep learning, NLP techniques, model training, and web app deployment.
6. This project can be used as a practical example of how deep learning algorithms can be used to categorize large volumes of text data and deployed as web applications.
